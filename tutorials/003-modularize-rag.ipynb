    "In Object Orienteed Programming, we attempt to modularize components into reusable components using classes and methods. For our lab, we created three components in the ingestion pipline. Namely, the vectordb, loader and chunking component. Each components will then be composed using the AdamIngest class in ingest.py to create the pipeline. As clean coders, we allow developers to pass by values or by keyword arguments as well as component configuration in the form of dictionaries to facilitate faster experimentation."
